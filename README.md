## Data

Canonical subdivision seed CSVs live in `data/subdivisions/`.

The main fetch script is:

- `scripts/fetch_subdivision_data.py`

## Build setup

```sh
uv sync --extra deck
```

## Deck builds

Build the South Africa package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_south_africa_apkg.py
```

Output:

- `out/south-africa-provinces.apkg`

Build the Mexico package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_mexico_apkg.py
```

Output:

- `out/mexico-federative-entities.apkg`

Turkey now also has a country-specific builder because its seven geographical regions do not have official capitals.

Build the Turkey package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_turkey_apkg.py
```

Output:

- `out/turkey-regions.apkg`

Build the Iran package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_iran_apkg.py
```

Output:

- `out/iran-provinces.apkg`
